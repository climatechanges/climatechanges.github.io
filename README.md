# Climate Change Visualization Project
## Overview
This project provides an interactive platform to explore the impacts of climate change, focusing on global trends in temperature and precipitation. By analyzing datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the project highlights historical and current environmental changes, offering a global and regional perspective. Users can dive into data visualizations that make climate change both accessible and personal, helping them understand its effects on their local areas.

## Purpose and Scope
The project addresses the pressing issue of climate change by presenting key data trends and patterns. Through interactive visualizations, it aims to raise awareness and provide a better understanding of how the challenges posed by global warming, affects them at a global and local level. 

## Questions Explored
- How have global and regional temperatures and precipitation changed over time?
- Which regions face the highest exposure to climate-related phenomena, like extreme weather events?
- How do greenhouse gas emissions correlate with observed changes?
- How are extreme weather events, such as violent storms, flooding, and wildfires, evolving globally?

## Data Sources
We used a range of high-quality datasets to ensure the accuracy and relevance of our findings:

- **[GISS Surface Temperature Analysis:](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)** Tracks global and hemispheric temperature anomalies from 1880 to the present.
- **[NASA EARTHDATA U.S. Climate Risk Projects:](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/crv-us-climate-risk-proj-county-2040-2049/data-download#close )** Contains a projection for 2040-2049 risk for the entire contiguous U.S. at the county level.
- **[Global Seawater Oxygen-18 Database:](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/o18data/)** Contains over 26,000 data points on seawater attributes like temperature, salinity, and isotopic composition.
- **[OECD Precipitation and Exposure Data:](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_ECH%40EXT_PREC&df[ag]=OECD.ENV.EPI&df[vs]=1.1&dq=AFG%2BBFA%2BBDI%2BCAF%2BTCD%2BSWZ%2BETH%2BGUF%2BATF%2BGLP%2BHMD%2BVAT%2BKAZ%2BXKV%2BKGZ%2BLAO%2BLSO%2BLIE%2BMWI%2BMLI%2BMTQ%2BMDA%2BMNG%2BNPL%2BNER%2BNFK%2BMKD%2BPRY%2BREU%2BRWA%2BSMR%2BSRB%2BSGS%2BSSD%2BTJK%2BTKM%2BUGA%2BUMI%2BUZB%2BZMB%2BZWE%2BIOT%2BBVT%2BBWA%2BBOL%2BBTN%2BBLR%2BAZE%2BARM%2BAND%2BCHE%2BSVK%2BLUX%2BHUN%2BCZE%2BAUT%2BALB%2BDZA%2BASM%2BAGO%2BAIA%2BATG%2BARG%2BABW%2BBHS%2BBHR%2BGGY%2BBGD%2BBRB%2BBLZ%2BBEN%2BBMU%2BBIH%2BBRA%2BVGB%2BBRN%2BBGR%2BCPV%2BKHM%2BCMR%2BCYM%2BCHN%2BCXR%2BCOM%2BCOG%2BCOK%2BCIV%2BHRV%2BCUB%2BCYP%2BPRK%2BCOD%2BDJI%2BDMA%2BDOM%2BECU%2BEGY%2BSLV%2BGNQ%2BERI%2BFRO%2BFJI%2BPYF%2BGAB%2BGMB%2BGEO%2BGHA%2BGRL%2BGRD%2BGUM%2BGTM%2BGIN%2BGNB%2BGUY%2BHTI%2BHND%2BHKG%2BIND%2BIDN%2BIRN%2BIRQ%2BIMN%2BJAM%2BJEY%2BJOR%2BKEN%2BKIR%2BKWT%2BLBN%2BLBR%2BLBY%2BMAC%2BMDG%2BMYS%2BMDV%2BMLT%2BMHL%2BMRT%2BMUS%2BMYT%2BFSM%2BMCO%2BMNE%2BMSR%2BMAR%2BMOZ%2BMMR%2BNAM%2BNRU%2BNCL%2BNIC%2BNGA%2BNIU%2BMNP%2BOMN%2BPAK%2BPLW%2BPSE%2BPAN%2BPNG%2BPER%2BPHL%2BPCN%2BPRI%2BQAT%2BROU%2BRUS%2BSHN%2BKNA%2BLCA%2BSPM%2BVCT%2BWSM%2BSTP%2BSAU%2BSEN%2BSYC%2BSLE%2BSGP%2BSLB%2BSOM%2BZAF%2BLKA%2BSDN%2BSUR%2BSJM%2BSYR%2BTWN%2BTZA%2BTHA%2BTLS%2BTGO%2BTKL%2BTON%2BTTO%2BTUN%2BTCA%2BTUV%2BUKR%2BARE%2BVIR%2BURY%2BVUT%2BVEN%2BVNM%2BWLF%2BESH%2BYEM%2BAU1%2BAU2%2BAU3%2BAU4%2BAU5%2BAU6%2BAU7%2BAU8%2BAUS%2BBEL%2BCAN%2BCHL%2BCOL%2BCRI%2BDNK%2BEST%2BFIN%2BFRA%2BDEU%2BGRC%2BISL%2BIRL%2BISR%2BITA%2BJPN%2BKOR%2BLVA%2BLTU%2BMEX%2BNLD%2BNZL%2BNOR%2BPOL%2BPRT%2BSVN%2BESP%2BSWE%2BTUR%2BGBR%2BUSA%2BG7%2BG20%2BEU27%2BOECD%2BOECDA%2BOECDSO%2BOECDE%2BAES%2BEMES%2BIPAC.A.99PT_LAND_EXP..W1T2...&lom=LASTNPERIODS&lo=5&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false&vw=ov&ly[cl]=TIME_PERIOD&ly[rw]=REF_AREA)** Provides detailed data about changes in annual precipitation, and exposure to various land types to extreme precipitation events.
